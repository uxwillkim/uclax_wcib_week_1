    <h4>Hello World!</h4>
    <p>
      Hey all! Looking forward to learning frontend web development alongside with everyone. I come from 10+ years working in the ad agency world, but most recently having co-founded a legal-tech startup company in Los Angeles. I have zero education in web development, so this is all new and exciting for me to get into. I am enrolled in the UX certificate program for UCLA extention. Last but not least, I am working off a 13" Macbook Pro (2018), running macOS Catalina.

      For this week's assignment, I didn't run into any major roadblocks getting the local and hosting environments set up. It did take a bit of time to follow along step-by-step; I would periodically pause the video tutorial and double check I was doing the right things, also taking the time write down some notes on my notepad (i.e. handy terminal commands and mapping out processes on paper).
